# learning_module

## overview

The learning module is a tool to help you
learn with a hands-on approach to coding,
in this case, it's written in `X`, it also
includes notes throughout the project to
give further information.

If you wanna learn some other language or add
more languages to your list then look around
for a learning module with the programming language
you wish to learn.
